# Time-Series Momentum

This repository contains the full pipeline for building and running a production-grade time-series momentum strategy on U.S. equities.

ðŸ“ˆ **Momentum Strategy**  
The strategy is based on a core concept in quantitative finance: securities that have recently outperformed (or underperformed) tend to continue doing so in the short term. We adapt this concept into a systematic, real-world trading implementation using highly liquid, optionable stocks.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Point-in-Time Universe Construction**  
  - Filters historical stock data to eliminate survivorship bias.  
  - Requires at least $50M in notional volume and consistent weekly options listings.  

- **Custom Momentum Scoring**  
  - Combines risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe) and market sensitivity (Beta).  
  - Generates a momentum score to rank stocks in each monthly cycle.

- **Fully Automated Long/Short Portfolio Construction**
  - Ranks tickers monthly into deciles.
  - Rebalances monthly based on updated scores.
  - Outputs long and short baskets ready for trading or analysis.

## ðŸš€ Faster Backtests

`mtum-backtest-public.py` now supports multiple market data providers and
automatic caching so that you only download each symbol once. Key options:

- `--provider {polygon|alpaca}` to choose Polygon.io or Alpaca Markets.
- Environment variables (`POLYGON_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_API_KEY`,
  `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`) or CLI flags to pass credentials securely.
- `--cache-dir` and `--force-refresh` to manage on-disk caching of daily bars.
- `--prefetch` to warm the cache up-front. Alpaca requests now batch up to
  200 symbols per call so you can hydrate the cache much faster than
  previously possible.
- `--max-workers` controls the Alpaca batch size if you need to stay below the
  default limit.

The backtest pulls the full lookback window for every symbol a single time and
reuses it across monthly iterations. Runtime is typically constrained by API
throughput rather than the daily bar frequency, so batching requests with
Alpaca or caching Polygon downloads provides the biggest speedups.
