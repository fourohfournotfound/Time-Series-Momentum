# Time-Series Momentum

This repository contains the full pipeline for building and running a production-grade time-series momentum strategy on U.S. equities.

ðŸ“ˆ **Momentum Strategy**  
The strategy is based on a core concept in quantitative finance: securities that have recently outperformed (or underperformed) tend to continue doing so in the short term. We adapt this concept into a systematic, real-world trading implementation using highly liquid, optionable stocks.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Point-in-Time Universe Construction**  
  - Filters historical stock data to eliminate survivorship bias.  
  - Requires at least $50M in notional volume and consistent weekly options listings.  

- **Custom Momentum Scoring**  
  - Combines risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe) and market sensitivity (Beta).  
  - Generates a momentum score to rank stocks in each monthly cycle.

- **Fully Automated Long/Short Portfolio Construction**  
  - Ranks tickers monthly into deciles.  
  - Rebalances monthly based on updated scores.  
  - Outputs long and short baskets ready for trading or analysis.
